# Group Generator
Generate random groups based on fair grades.

Access here: https://max-prime-math.github.io/group-generator/generator.html

A privacy-focused, educator-specific group generator designed to handle student data securely while maintaining an engaging classroom experience.

## Key Features

### Privacy and Grade Protection
* **Stealth Editor:** Numbers and percentages are automatically ghosted (made invisible) in the editor while typing, so students looking at the screen cannot see their grades.
* **Snake-Sort Balancing:** Automatically balances groups by grade (pairing high-achievers with those needing support) without making the ranking obvious.
* **Triple-Shuffle Logic:** 1. Shuffles student names within groups.
    2. Shuffles the order of the groups on screen.
    3. Assigns fresh, ordered numbering (Group 1, Group 2, etc.) only after the shuffle, completely obscuring original student ranks.

### Classroom Tools
* **Purple Rep Picker:** An animated representative selection tool that cycles through students in a vibrant purple flash.
* **Rep-to-Top:** Once a representative is chosen, they are automatically moved to the top of their group list for easy identification.
* **Creative Team Names:** Click any group title to instantly swap Group numbers for a fun name like "The Caffeine Cartel" or "Logic Legends."
* **Student View:** One-click transition to a clean, full-screen mode that hides all settings, sidebars, and data inputs for projection.

### Classroom Management
* **Attendance Tracking:** Click a student's name to mark them as absent. The Rep Picker will automatically ignore absent students.
* **Class Manager:** Save multiple class lists locally to your browser. Use the Reset button to clear your current workspace without losing your saved classes.
* **Flexible Grouping:** Toggle between "Students per Group" or "Total Number of Groups."
* **Export and Copy:** Quickly generate a formatted text list of all groups (including reps and attendance status) to copy into your lesson plans or LMS.

3. **Generate:** Click Generate. You can click this multiple times to reshuffle instantly.
4. **Manage Attendance:** If a student is away, click their name to gray them out.
